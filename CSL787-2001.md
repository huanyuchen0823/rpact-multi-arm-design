# Assumptions

In this clinical trial design, we assume an 80% power ($\beta$) and a
one-sided significance level ($\alpha$) of 0.1. Subjects will be
followed for a maximum of 1 year, with the last subject being followed
for 0.5 years. The accrual time is 1.83 years, and the study duration is
2.33 years. The hazard rate ($\lambda$) for the placebo group is assumed
to be 1.2 per year. The hazard ratios are set at 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9,
assuming an exponential distribution of events. The trial uses a 2:1
allocation ratio, meaning two subjects in the treatment group for every
one subject in the placebo group. This trial does not allow for early
stopping due to efficacy, ensuring that the study reaches its planned
conclusion unless futility is determined.

# Task

1.  Given an 80% power ($\beta$) and a one-sided significance level
    ($\alpha$) of 0.1, calculate the sample size needed to achieve this
    goal for a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6.

2.  Replicate the power based on a fixed sample size derived in step 1
    to check the accuracy of the calculation.

3.  Generalize the results to different hazard ratios of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8,
    and 0.9.

    1.  Given an 80% power ($\beta$) and a one-sided significance level
        ($\alpha$) of 0.1, calculate the sample size needed to achieve
        this goal for different hazard ratios.

    2.  Calculate the power based on the sample size for HR = 0.6 to
        check how different hazard ratios influence the probability.

# Compare rpact results with EAST results

## EAST results

The table below shows the EAST results from Gaya. This is a fixed sample
design with 48 subjects per arm and a total of 78 events. The allocation
rate is 2:1 and other assumptions remain the same.

## rpact results

What I did for replicating the results:

1.  Since rpact did not have an output function for the rho parameter, I
    defined the beta spending at the interim analysis manually at the
    first step.
2.  Then I returned the results for the exit probability for futility at
    the interim analysis and compared with the highlighted values in the
    table. We can find that we will get the same values.

``` r
design <- getDesignGroupSequential(kMax = 2, typeOfDesign = "noEarlyEfficacy",
                                   alpha = 0.1, typeBetaSpending = "bsUser",
                                   userBetaSpending = c(0.035, 0.2))
summary(getPowerSurvival(design, directionUpper = FALSE, lambda2 = 1.2, hazardRatio = 0.6,
                         maxNumberOfEvents = 80, allocationRatioPlanned = 2,
                         accrualTime = c(0, 1.83), accrualIntensity = 79))
```

## Conclusion

The results are the same. This gives us confidence to move forward with
rpact. I used the Beta Spending O’Brien & Fleming function (bsOF) for
later analysis in rpact because it is the internal function, but I am
open to other methods based on needs.

## Results and Interpretation

`Futility probabilities under H1` = `Cumulative beta spent` = 0.0699

This design includes an O’Brien & Fleming beta spending approach, where
the probability of stopping for futility is controlled and accumulates
across stages.

# HR = 0.6

## Introduction

My goal in this section will focus on two things:

1.  Defining a fixed power and calculating the sample size.

2.  Calculating power based on a fixed sample size.

We can further find in this section that the sample size corresponds to
the power, i.e., the sample size calculated after the power is
determined in the first step can get the same power in the second step.

## Sample Size

### Results and Interpretation

The calculation indicates that for an 80% power and a one-sided
significance level of 0.1, the sample sizes required are 97.7 subjects
in the first stage and 124.6 subjects in the second stage. The
cumulative number of events expected is 83.1. The overall exit
probability for futility under the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is 53.04%,
and under the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$), it is 6.99%. The expected
study duration is approximately 2.27 years. This design ensures that the
study will have sufficient power to detect the specified hazard ratio
with the given parameters.

## Power

### Assumptions and Code Explanations

`directionUpper = FALSE` indicates that the incidence of treatment arm
is lower than placebo.

`typeOfComputation = "Schoenfeld"` shows that it is based on the
proportional hazards model and provides log-rank tests to compare the
survival curves.

`kappa = 1` stands for the exponential survival distribution.

`maxNumberOfEvents` uses the data 83.1 calculated in the previous sample
size section.

`accrualIntensity` is calculated as: max Number Of Subjects / accrual
time. In this example, I am using the data calculated in the previous
sample size section, which is 124.6/1.83 = 68.09.

Both codes will give exactly the same result. The only difference in the
code is `accrualIntensity = 68.09` and `maxNumberOfSubjects = 124.6`,
but as we said, they mean the same thing and can be converted to each
other.

### Code and Output

                         maxNumberOfSubjects = 124.6, maxNumberOfEvents = 83.1,
                         allocationRatioPlanned = 2, accrualTime = c(0, 1.83), kappa = 1))
```

Legend:

- *(t)*: treatment effect scale

### Results and Interpretation

`Exit probability for futility (under H0)` = 0.5304 and
`Exit probability for futility (under H1)` = 0.0700.

This design allows for early stopping due to futility, with a 53.04%
probability of stopping if the null hypothesis is true (no treatment
effect) and a 7% probability if the alternative hypothesis is true
(treatment effect).

## Conclusion

In this section, our results successfully conclude that sample size
corresponds to power.

Specifically,

`Number of subjects` = 124.6 and `Cumulative number of events` = 83.1

corresponds to

`Exit probability for futility (under H0)` = 0.5304 and
`Exit probability for futility (under H1)` = 0.0700.

## Next Step:

I am now trying to generalize the case of HR = 0.6 to different HRs.

The ideas are still broken down into two parts:

1.  Given the power (derived from alpha/beta), we can get different
    sample sizes for different HRs.

2.  Given the sample size (which I based on the HR = 0.6 case while
    referring to Gaya’s calculations in EAST, but this is open to
    discussion), calculate power for the case of different HRs.

Only the HRs in the code are changed.

# Combine Different HRs

Can focus on: `Number of subjects` and `Cumulative number of events`.

The sample size and number of events required for the trial increase
significantly as the HR approaches 1. This is because detecting smaller
differences between groups requires a larger sample size and more events
to achieve the desired statistical power (80%). For instance, to detect
an HR of 0.6, only 124.6 subjects and 83.1 events are needed. However,
for an HR of 0.9, the trial would require 2583.0 subjects and 1954.4
events. This reflects the increased difficulty in detecting smaller
differences and the need for more data to draw reliable conclusions.

Below is a sample output table that summarizes the important output:

| Hazard Ratio (HR) | Number of Subjects (Stage 1) | Number of Subjects (Stage 2) | Cumulative Number of Events (Stage 1) | Cumulative Number of Events (Stage 2) |

### Results and Interpretation

- **Exit probability for futility (under H1) given the overall sample
  size = 124.6:**

  - HR = 0.6: 7.00% probability of stopping early for futility (under
    H1).

  - HR = 0.7: 15.68% probability of stopping early for futility (under
    H1).

  - HR = 0.8: 27.37% probability of stopping early for futility (under
    H1).

  - HR = 0.9: 40.37% probability of stopping early for futility (under
    H1).

- **Expected number of subjects under H1:**

  - Expected number of subjects under H1 decreases from 122.7 (HR = 0.6)
    to 109.9 (HR = 0.9).

  - The expected number of subjects decreases with increasing HR values,
    indicating a higher likelihood of early stopping as the treatment
    effect diminishes.
